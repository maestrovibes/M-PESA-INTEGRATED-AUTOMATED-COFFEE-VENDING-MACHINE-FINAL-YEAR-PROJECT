 **PROBLEM STATEMENT**
 
The current solutions to assist coffee shops with their purchase transactions and authenticate customer payments are expensive, inefficient, and may cause dissatisfaction to customers. In light of this, this project involves the research and development of an automated coffee vending machine with a reliable payment system, integrated with the M-PESA STK method, in order to reduce the cost of labour, improve the efficiency of the purchase transactions, and to enable customers to securely make payments. 

**JUSTIFICATION**

The development of an automated coffee vending machine is necessary in order to meet the growing demand for easily accessible coffee. This project is justified as it seeks to provide a convenient and secure payment system that supports the M-PESA STK method, ensuring the safety and reliability of consumer transactions. Additionally, automating the vending process can help reduce the costs of operations for businesses, while the secure payment system will raise the overall trustworthiness of the transaction. This project will take an important step towards modernizing the coffee vending process, potentially leading to greater customer satisfaction and improved commercial efficiency.

**OBJECTIVES**

a)	To develop an automated coffee vending machine. 
b)	To develop a control module that accurately dispenses the desired quantity of coffee.
c)	To integrate an M-PESA STK-based payment system with the vending system.
d)	To test the reliability of the automated coffee vending machine. 

**PROJECT SCOPE**

This project covers development an automated coffee vending machine that can securely and accurately dispense one type of coffee. This machine is specifically designed for the Kenyan market due to its M-PESA payments feature and it can remain operational for 24 hours a day. The payment system supports M-PESA STK as the primary payment method for the vending machine.
